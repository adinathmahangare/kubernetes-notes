### History

- Google -> Cloud Native Computing Foundation
- <b>written in Go</b>
- github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
- <b>open source</b> 
- shares DNA to Borg -> Omega (google inhouse project for infrastructure of cloud)
- K8s = Kubernetes (replacing 8 characters between k and s)

### Challenges with Containers - Need for Kubernetes

- need of thousands of containers
- harder to manage
- Kubernetes works as a abstraction level to manage containers

### Definition

- Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.

## Different Software Development Models

### monolith model

- single codebase
- multiple business functions
- ex. porting, logging, database
- contains multiple services

### microservices

- breaks services into individual applications
- loosely coupled
- developed, build, shipped independently
- scaled independently, updtated and patched independently
- provides more flexibility
- communication between multiple applications is quite complicated

### Cloud Native

- ability of an application that can be run anywhere
- public cloud, private cloud, or on prem kubernetes
